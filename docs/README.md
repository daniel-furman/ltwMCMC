To import the package to the base conda environment in the shell (for example, to use in Jupyter notebooks):

`/opt/anaconda3/bin/pip install lwMCMC`

You may need to change the location of the base conda env (for example, type `which python` in the base env). 

Once in the Jupyter notebook, import the main class as follows:

`from lwMCMC import MCMC`

You can type `?MCMC` for info.
